# IMPPub
IMP routines that can be read directly into an RSS reader on localhost. Note that I made the RSS feeds for brains seperate from RSS feeds that don't represent mental activity.

## Solving the alignment problem
My specific method solving the alignment problem.

## Subscriptions
Each routine has corresponding feed folder to subscribe to in an RSS reader. The main directory is currently seperate for Brain RSS.

Main feed:
~~~
http://localhost:8000/_feed/feed.xml
~~~

Each Brain activity has its own feed folder.

## Based On RSSPub
For those interested on knowing what IMPPub is based on and extended from.

## Domain Specific XML
Eventually I'm going to be transitioning to feed parser and domain specific XML pages.
